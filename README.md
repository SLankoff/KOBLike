![Foundry v12](https://img.shields.io/badge/foundry-v12-green)

This system is a Build your own KOB-Like sytem. I'm working on it.

To-Do:
More Biography stuff
Do...Something with item/feature properties
Automated Adversity on Realtime messages (toggleable)
Stretch: Configurable dice scale menu
Hooks on card shows
Iron out stuff I did badly (exploding dice?)
Enrich HTML
Read Item Subtypes on creation
_expand on sheets should be client side somehow
force dice so nice roll order
